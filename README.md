# Procurely

Procurely is a one-stop solution for manufacturers and vendors to perform their daily tasks all in one place with end-to-end capability on our web app with all stakeholders taking part in the process. Manufacturers can list their customized requirements with budget and time schedules. Vendors who accept the conditions can apply for tender. The procurement manager can see the list of the vendors on the basis of reviews, budgets, timelines, and modes of delivery. After the tender deadline, the procurement manager can comment or direct message(on Procurely itself) the vendor for negotiation purposes. Then the vendor revises the tender and submits the final proposal. Now the Manager chooses the best available proposal and that becomes the final agreement.

Other features include vendor rating and agreement history, customized RFP(request for proposal), and the whole process of procurement on one platform which will drastically reduce the time taken for each agreement.
